Trading System overview

1. Event = the evenr is the fundament class unit of the event-driven system
    Contains a TYPE= "MARKET,SIGNAL,ORDER, FILL" - which determein how it will be handled within event loop
2. Event Queue = the event queue is an in-memeory py queue pbject that stores all the Event sub-calss objects 
    which are generated by other parts in software
3. DataHandler = abstract base class that present an interface fro handling both istorical or live-market data
    provides signifcant flexibility as the Stragey and Portfolio modules ca thus be reused between both approaches.#
    This generates a new MarketEvent upon every heartbeat of the system.
4. Strategy = abstract base class that present an interface for takig market data and generating corresponding SignalEvents.
    Which are utilised by the Portfolio object.
    A signalEvent contains a ticker symb, a dorection (LONG|SHORT) and a timestamp
5. Portfolio = a class heiracrhy which handles the order management associated with current and subsequent positions for a strategy.
    Carroes out risk management across the portfolio, including sectir exposue, position sizing
    More sophisticated implementation coul dbe dlegated to RiskManagement class
    Takes SignalEvent from the queue and generated OrderEVents taht get added to the Queue

How to build:
1. Data Collection & Preparation
Historical Data: Gather reliable market data, including open, high, low, close (OHLC) prices and volume.
Data Cleansing: Ensure the data is free from anomalies such as missing values, outliers, or bad ticks.
Data Consistency: Adjust data to account for session times, contract rollovers (for futures), and split adjustments (for stocks)​
.
2. Core Strategy Testing Process
A strategy tester should evaluate trading rules through different methods:

A. Historical Backtesting
The most common method where the strategy is tested on past market data.
Requires defining:
Start and end date of the test.
Strategy parameters and indicators.
Order execution rules (market, limit, stop orders).
Slippage and commission assumptions​
.
B. Out-of-Sample Testing
Divides historical data into two segments:
In-sample (for training and optimization).
Out-of-sample (for validation).
Helps detect overfitting issues.
C. Walk-Forward Analysis
A more dynamic testing approach where:
Parameters are optimized on a rolling historical window.
The optimized strategy is then tested on the next unseen period.
The process repeats multiple times to mimic real-time adaptation​
.
D. Monte Carlo Simulations
Runs thousands of random variations of trade sequences to evaluate:
Performance robustness.
Worst-case scenarios.
Probability of ruin (capital depletion).
Useful for risk management​
.
E. Randomized "Monkey" Testing
Compares the strategy against a random trading system to ensure it is statistically significant.
Tests:
Random entries vs. actual strategy entries.
Random exits vs. actual exits.
Full randomization vs. strategy performance​
.
3. Key Metrics for Evaluation
To assess a trading strategy’s viability, the following performance metrics should be calculated:

Net Profit & Loss: Total gains/losses over the test period.
Maximum Drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough loss, crucial for risk assessment.
Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades.
Profit Factor: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return metric.
Expectancy: Average expected profit per trade​
.
